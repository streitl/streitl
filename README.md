- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lou
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in machine learning and its ethical applications to social fields where it can have an positive impact, such as the climate crisis, social inequalities, and many more.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about surveillance capitalism, in particular the online ads ecosystem, and about democratic data governance.
